✨ I obtained my Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering with Excellent Graduate Honor from [Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/), China. Currently, I am a Master student in Robotics at [Delft University of Technology (TU Delft)](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/), the Netherlands. 

🔭 I’m currently working as a **computer vision intern** at *[Lely Technologies](https://www.lely.com/nl/)*. Meanwhile, I am also working on the **autonomous navigation on Spot robot** at *[Yes!Delft Impact Lab](https://www.yesdelftimpactlab.com/)*.

🌱 I’m interested in robot planning and perception, especially the intersection area with machine learning. I support **slow science**.

🤔 Previously, I worked on passive assisted exoskeleton and online motion planning for industrial manipulators. I am skilled in **mechanical design, machining, and rapid prototyping**.
